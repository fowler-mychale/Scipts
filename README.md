Scripts for Filtering spreadsheets

This script locates email addresses that follow a specific naming convention.:
   
   Mike.JonesDF@example.com, 
   MylesgNd@example.com, 
   RufinoS@example.com

From those examples the script will locate email address whose last two letters are uppercase and place those results into a new csv file for review.
